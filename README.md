## About Jetstream-Inertia-Vue Multi-Auth

It is a user-based multiple authentication system developed using Laravel Jetstream With Inertia and Vue. It has the same features of a single user of Jetstream like Login, Register, Email Verification, Forgot Password,  Two-Step Verification, API Services, Logout other browser session and delete user, etc. for administrator and user as well. 
 - I've added the SocialStream Package for Social Authentication.
 - and the administrator can view the User List on his dashboard.
